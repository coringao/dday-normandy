**How to contribute**
---------------------

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

I love contributions from everyone!

There are only a few guidelines that we encourage contributors to follow
so that we can accept and maintain third party changes.

Notice that "D-Day Normandy" is licensed under the terms of the GPLv2 license,
so by submitting content to the repository, you release your work
to the public domain.

**Getting Started**
-------------------

1. Make sure you have a GIT account.
2. Submit your issue (ensure the same issue does not already exists).
3. Try to clearly describe the issue, and include steps to reproduce
when it is a bug.

**Creating the fork**
---------------------

Talk to us! E.G. create an issue about your idea or problem.

Fork the repository and work in a meaningful named branch that is
based off of our **master**.

Commit in rather small chunks but don't split depending code across commits.
Please write sensible commit messages. Add tests for your feature or bugfix.

If in doubt request feedback from us!

When finished create a merge request.

Thank you for your interest!
