;
; The client side check variables file for the q2admin dll.
;
; Checking client side variables are set correctly for a specific mod
; can be enabled and disabled by the checkvarcmds_enable command.
;
; q2admincheckvar.txt is loaded from the Quake2 directory and then the mod directory 
; in that order.
; 
;
; The format for each check variable line is:
;
; CT: "<variablename>" "<value>"
; RG: "<variablename>" "<lower bound>" "<upper bound>"
;
;
; CT - (constant) is used for variables that are required to be only one value.  
;      This can be used for text variables as well has normal variables.
; 
; RG - (range) is used for variables that are required to be in a range of values.
;      This can only be used for variables that hold number values.
;
;
;e.g.
;CT: "gl_modulate" "1"
; This will only allow the gl_modulate variable to be a value of "1".
;
;RG: "gl_lockpvs" "1" "2"
; This will only allow gl_lockpvs values to be between 1 and 2.
