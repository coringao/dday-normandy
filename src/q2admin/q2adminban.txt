;
; The ban file list for the q2admin dll.
;
;
; Banning can be enabled and disabled by the 'nickbanning_enable', 
; 'ipbanning_enable' and 'chatbanning_enable' commands.  
;
; They can be enabled/disabled in the q2admin.txt by changing the
; there values to "Yes" or "No".
; 
; e.g. in the q2admin.log file:
; nickbanning_enable "Yes"
; ipbanning_enable "Yes"
; chatbanning_enable "Yes"
; 
; They can also be enabled/disabled from the server console / client admin 
; console as well.  See section 2.3 and 2.4 in the readme.txt for how to do 
; this.
; 
; q2adminban.txt is loaded from the Quake2 directory and then the mod directory 
; in that order.
; 
;
; The format for each ban line is:
;
; BAN: [+/-(-)] [ALL/[NAME [LIKE/RE] "name"/BLANK/ALL(ALL)] [IP xxx[.xxx(0)[.xxx(0)[.xxx(0)]]][/yy(32)]] [PASSWORD "xxx"] [MAX 0-xxx(0)] [FLOOD xxx(num) xxx(sec) xxx(silence] [MSG "xxx"]
;
; e.g.
; BAN: NAME LIKE "fuck"
; BAN: NAME BLANK MSG "no blank names allowed"
; BAN: IP 192.168.1.10
; BAN: + ALL MAX 10
; BAN: + IP 192.168/16
; BAN: ALL MSG "Down For Maintenance"

; BAN: + NAME LIKE "Fred" FLOOD 10 4 -1
;
;
