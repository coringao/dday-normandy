;
;The file q2admindisable.txt is read from the quake2 directory and the mod

;global and mod specific as well.
;
;The format for q2admindisable.txt is as follows:
;
;Lines beginning with a ';' are comments.
;
;disable command format:
;<disabletype><command to disable>
;
; <floodtype> can be one of three values:
; 'EX:'  Exact match.
; 'SW:'  Starts with match.
; 'RE:'  Regular Expression match. 
;
;e.g.
;SW:say_team

;RE:^say.*
;
; Note that internal commands to quake2 can't be monitored as
; mod's don't see these client commands. e.g. name, cl_maxfps, rate, etc 
;
;There is a limit of 1024 disable commands that can be setup.
